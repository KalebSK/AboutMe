## Experience

 - **Lockheed Martin Space & Michigan State University** (Jan 2022 - May 2022)
	 - [Python, Flask, Jenkins, Postgres, Docker]
	 - **Back-End Developer:** Designed and implemented back-end code for gathering performance metrics for new  applications uploaded to the App-Store. Used a Jenkins Continuous-Integration pipeline to automatically test  applications against different hardware boards with many SDKs. Processed performance metrics into JSON and  used a PostgreSQL database to store the results.
	 - **Lead Debugger:** Debugged problematic Python Flask back-end code base for the Satellite App-Store. Took  non-working back-end and made it completely functional.
	 - **Sysadmin:** Managed the Linux based production server for team development. Made sure each of the Docker containers for the individual components of the server were adequately configured. Verified each member of the team had access to the production server on personal development machines.
