# About Me

Hello! I am Software Engineer looking to kick-start my career at a company that allows for personal growth, a place where I can use my problem solving skills to develop products that meet customer needs, and a friendly team environment where everyone is working towards a common goal.


## Education

 - **Michigan State University**
	 - *Bachelor of Science in Computer Science; Major GPA: 3.88, **Overall GPA**: 3.82*
	 - Earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, specializing in a comprehensive curriculum that encompassed
key areas such as Algorithms and Data Structures, Object-Oriented Software Design, Mobile Application
Development, Web Application Architecture and Development, Database Systems, Computer Systems, Operating
Systems, and Computer Networks. Developed proficiency in a wide range of programming languages and tools,
including HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, C++, C, Python, Java, Android Studio, Visual Studio, PHP Storm,
and SQLite, through comprehensive coursework.


## Experience

 - **Lockheed Martin Space & Michigan State University** (Jan 2022 - May 2022)
	 - [Python, Flask, Jenkins, Postgres, Docker]
	 - Developed and implemented efficient back-end code for gathering performance metrics for Lockheed Martin’s
SmartSAT Satellite system applications, utilizing a Jenkins Continuous-Integration pipeline for automated testing
on dedicated hardware. Automating this process cut 30 to 60 mins of manual labor for users looking to track
application performance.
	 - Utilized Python to parse application performance data into JSON format and wrote SQL queries to seamlessly
integrate the data into the PostgreSQL database, ensuring accurate and accessible performance tracking
	 - Successfully debugged a problematic Python Flask back-end by identifying and resolving issues, while also
refactoring the code for improved functionality. Documented the debugging process to assist future engineers
working on the code base.
	 - Managed the Linux-based production server for team deployment, ensuring proper configuration of Docker
containers for system components and readiness for future updates and modifications.

 - **Ford Motor Company & Michigan State University** (Sep 2021 - Dec 2021)
	 - [UML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP]
	 - Conducted thorough requirement gathering sessions with a team to elicit and document detailed specifications for
the development of Active Park Assist, a software system for automated parking of motor vehicles. Utilized the
gathered requirements to create a comprehensive 67-page Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document,
encompassing system requirements, potential components, and their integrations through UML and user diagrams.
     - Developed an interactive web-based prototype of the Active Park Assist system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
ensuring widespread accessibility through modern browsers. Implemented animations using GSAP, a JavaScript
animation library, to enhance the prototype’s visual representation and user experience.

## Projects

 - **Sorry! Multiplayer game:** Designed and developed a web-based version of the classic board game Sorry! with multiplayer functionality. [PHP, JavaScript, CSS , HTML, TCP] 
 - **check it out here:** [Sorry! game](https://webdev.cse.msu.edu/~koebelk1/project2/)
- **SimpleFit Fitness Application W.I.P:** Developed SimpleFit, a progressive web application utilizing SolidJS, TypeScript, Deno, and PostgreSQL to
empower users to track and analyze their fitness progress. Implemented a custom user authentication system,
enabling users to securely sign up, save, track, and share their exercise and workout plans. Achieved fast and
efficient reactivity in the front-end through SolidJS and TypeScript, while leveraging Deno’s runtime to create a
robust and scalable RESTful API that seamlessly connects the front-end with the PostgreSQL database.
## Programming Skills
